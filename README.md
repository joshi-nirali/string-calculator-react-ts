# ðŸ§® String Calculator - TDD Kata

This project is a React + TypeScript implementation of the classic **String Calculator Kata** by Roy Osherove. It is built with a test-driven development (TDD) approach and follows the step-by-step scenarios defined in the kata.

## ðŸš€ Features Implemented

- âœ… `Add(string numbers)` method:
  - Returns `0` for empty string
  - Returns the sum of up to 2 numbers (e.g. `"1,2"` â†’ `3`)
  - Handles any number of comma-separated numbers
  - Accepts newlines as delimiters (e.g. `"1\n2,3"` â†’ `6`)
  - Supports custom delimiters (e.g. `"//;\n1;2"` â†’ `3`)
  - Supports multiple and multi-character delimiters (e.g. `"//[***][%%]\n1***2%%3"` â†’ `6`)
  - Throws an error if any negative number is present
  - Ignores numbers greater than 1000
  - Tracks how many times `Add()` has been called

- âœ… `GetCalledCount()` method
- âœ… Optional event trigger after `Add()` (used for logging)
- âœ… Full test coverage with **Jest**
- âœ… User interface built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and functional components
